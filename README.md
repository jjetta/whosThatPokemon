This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.
(Note:* you may have to run npm install initially)

# Project Info:

This is basically a makeshift podedex from scratch written in Angular. It makes calls to PokeAPI (link: https://pokeapi.co/) for the data and the responses populate the pokedex cards! 

# How to Run:

Run `ng serve -o` to spin up a dev server. The -o flag navigates to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application automatically reloads when any of the source files are changed.
