Welcome! This was a nice little project I made last summer during my internship! I just remade the repository because the last one was only a zip file and you couldn't see the code.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.
(Note* you may have to run npm install initially!)

## How to Run:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. \n PRO TIP!: If you run `ng serve -o` it will automatically navigate to the site!
