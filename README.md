# whosThatPokemon

Welcome! This was a nice little project I made last summer during my internship! I just remade the repository because the last one was only a zip file and you couldn't see the code.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.
(Note* you may have to run npm install initially!)

# Project Info:

I'm pretty sure 99.9% of you reading this have watch Pokemon growing up, or have at least heard of it! This is basically a makeshift podedex from scratch written in Angular. It makes calls to the PokeAPI (link: https://pokeapi.co/) for the data the responses populate the pokedex cards! 

# How to Run:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. <br> PRO TIP!: If you run `ng serve -o` it will automatically navigate to the site!
